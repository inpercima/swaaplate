# {{PROJECT.TITLE}} - docker

## Getting started

Normally the docker version is used to build and run the productive version, so it is prepared as productive.

```bash
# build the image and container
docker-compose build

# run the container
docker-compose up -d

# run the container and rebuild
docker-compose up -d --build

# stop the container
docker-compose down
```
